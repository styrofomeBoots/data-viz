# Unit 19 - Project 2

## Overview

This week is all project work days and Project 2 Presentations.
We recommend running students through the Heroku deployment guide during Project 2 week to ensure that they are able to deploy applications. If you have a preferred tool for deployment, you are more than welcome to introduce them to that in lieu of Heroku.
